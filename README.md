# SDLSampleGame
A small intro to a SDL game in c++


To play :
type make inside the current folder, than ./ELPEPE (linux)

move the player with wasd keys, the UI selections with arrows (<- & ->).
Once you have a weapon equipped, Q and SPACE to perform the two possible attacks.

NOTE: i made this game with the intent of studying the SDL library , which was used to make a lot of games in the past (e.g METAL SLUG)
the game it's just a preview , and it has no serious implementation. i used sprites found on the internet (primarly on itch.io) , and i modified them to serve a purpose in my game.
Enjoy
