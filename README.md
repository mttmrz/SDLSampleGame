# ELPEPE
*A C++ Learning Adventure with SDL*

## Overview
ELPEPE is a 2D action game (demo) developed as a personal learning project during my journey into C++ programming. Built with the SDL library, this project represents my early exploration of game development concepts and C++ fundamentals.

**Note**: This project was developed using C++98 standards and reflects my learning process at the timeâ€”expect some rough edges and learning experiments!

## About SDL
This project leverages the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL), a powerful cross-platform development library widely used in the game industry. Notable games built with SDL include:

- **Terraria** - The beloved 2D sandbox adventure
- **Super Meat Boy** - The challenging platformer
- **Celeste** - The acclaimed indie platformer

- Character movement and animation
- Combat system implementation
- Object interaction mechanics
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Acknowledgments
Developed as a self-taught project to explore game development concepts and improve C++ programming skills. While the code may not follow all modern best practices, it represents genuine learning and experimentation with game development fundamentals.
